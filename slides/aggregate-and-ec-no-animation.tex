    Even here the neural network is shared with all agents, but the improvement is guided during the simulation itself.
    So we do not need a correct ground truth for each time step, but we only need to specify a fitness 
    function that evaluates the overall behaviour of the system. 
    This type of method is used in swarm robotics and even in automatic design. 
    Here we observe very low performance in converging to a good solution. 
    Sometimes a solution is never reached and the search is trapped in a local minimum
