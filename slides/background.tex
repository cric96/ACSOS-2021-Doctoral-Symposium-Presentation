    So, my research consists mainly of engineering Collective (Self-)Adaptive System.
    They can be defined as distributed and interconnected systems composed of multiple agents
    that can perform complex tasks such as environmental data collection,
    search and rescue operations, and discovery of natural resources. 
    So the collective exhibit robust behaviour while achieving system-wide and agent-specific goals.
    For years, there have been various approaches in the literature to deal with these systems. 
    In my research group, we focus on Aggregate Computing.
