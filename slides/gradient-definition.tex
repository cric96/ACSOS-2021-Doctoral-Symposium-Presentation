  \pdfcomment{
    Currently, our reference building block is the gradient from a source zone.
    It generates a computational field in which each node generates the distance from a node marked as a source. 
    The hop count problem is similar. Instead of evaluating the distance, the program returns the number of hops from a destination node.
    A naive implementation of this algorithm consists in: i) taking the minimum value from 
    the neighbour field and ii) incremented by the distance to it. eventually, the right field 
    will be produced.

%% Here put an image that show the step to compute this field.
