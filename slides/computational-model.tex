    Before I talk about my early works, let me briefly explain what aggregate computing is. 
    Here, we view a system as a large group of computing nodes connected by a neighbour relationship, 
    which can be either physical (i.e., one node has a connection to another node) or logical/position-based.
    Each node has only a partial view of the entire system. Interaction with the neighbourhood 
    is done through message passing.
