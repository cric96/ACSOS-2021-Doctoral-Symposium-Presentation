    Before speaking about my early works, let me briefly explain how aggregate computing computes. 
    Here, we view a system as a large group of computing nodes connected by a neighbour relationship, 
    which can be either physical (i.e., one node has a connection to another node) 
    or logical/position-based. Each node has only a partial view of the entire system. 
    Interaction with the neighbourhood is done through message passing.
