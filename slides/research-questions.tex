    The research directions we want to tackle are: 
    i) what kind of machine learning is useful in combination with Aggregate Computing? 
    ii) at what level of abstraction can Machine Learning be useful for Aggregate Computing? 
    iii) what does Aggregate Computing have in common with ML, applied to Collective Adaptive System?
