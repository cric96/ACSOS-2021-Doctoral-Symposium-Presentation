    In summary, this first year of my research has allowed me to observe current trends in CSAS. 
    Our goal is to endow Aggregate Computing with intelligence, which in itself is a good framework for
    this kind of system
    The first experimental tests have shown that Reinforcement Learning seems to be a good method that can be applied in our scenario, 
    even if we need a deeper analysis to verify its effectiveness in other applications.
